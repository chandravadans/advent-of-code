### Advent of Code
This repository contains my attempts to solve the excellent [Advent of Code challenges by Eric Wastl](https://adventofcode.com).
It's an annual ritual I like to have, and I've had a varying degrees of success with the challenges over the years.

### Structure
Each year's challenges are checked into the repository on the branch corresponding to that particular year. 2022's
solutions are on the branch `2022`, for example. The main branch doesn't contain any solutions, and is devoid of everything
but a `HelloAoC` program that very helpfully adds two numbers that it's handed over.
